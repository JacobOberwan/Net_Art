        <h10> From the commercial debut of electricity in the form of a lightbulb, to todayâ€™s modern computers, light as an art medium has been around for well over a century. Pixel art is the creation of an image by using smaller boxes, or pixels of different colors. With the boom of silicone valley, the ability to display pixels has been growing exponentially in quantity and amount of tones since the 80s. 
            Even though early limitations in retro games has long since been overcome, the restraint that was exercised by early game designers and pixel artists created a design language and aesthetic that still exists in modern pixel art, even outside of videogames.
