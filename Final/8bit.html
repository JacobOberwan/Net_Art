       <h4>A bit is the most simple form of unit in computation either being 0 or 1. Using this logic a bit can store 2 color tones
     which would generally be black and white. The amount of possible tones is equal to 2 rasied to the power of the amount of bits.

       <h4> After gaming got its start with 1-bit, the rate of innovation allowed for an immediate jump to 8 bit consoles allowing for 256 possilbe tones. This still limited color palette forced a level of restraint that give early videogames their distinctive design aesthetics.

       <h4> Ken Sugimori designed many of the original generation of Pokemon. His water color style translated wonderfully to working with a limited palette. The protaginists themselves appear short and stubby in their early renders as well as they would in pixel form.

       <h4> Even though polygon 3-D graphics has long since been the standard of videogame graphics, 2-D pixel based games are still being created and played. These games often pay homage to games of the past in design and style, notably like the short chubby characters that first appeared at Nintendo.
